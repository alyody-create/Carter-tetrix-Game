# 🚀 Deployment Fix Guide

## The Build Error

The error `Could not resolve "./src/main.jsx" from "index.html"` is a Vite configuration issue that can be resolved with these steps.

## ✅ Solution 1: Updated Files

I've updated the following files to fix the build:

### 1. Fixed `vite.config.js`:
- Added proper Node.js URL resolution
- Configured build output settings
- Added alias resolution for `@` to `./src`

### 2. Fixed `src/main.jsx`:
- Removed `.jsx` extension from App import
- This follows Vite best practices

### 3. Fixed `src/App.jsx`:
- Added explicit React import
- Ensures compatibility with build process

## 🔄 Alternative Solution (If Still Failing)

If the build still fails, try replacing the `index.html` content with:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Jello Tetrix - Physics-Based Tetris</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Note**: Use `/src/main.jsx` (absolute path) instead of `./src/main.jsx` (relative path)

## 🎯 Expected Result

After these fixes, the build should:
1. ✅ Complete successfully without errors
2. ✅ Generate a `dist` folder with optimized files  
3. ✅ Deploy correctly on Vercel

## 🔍 Verification Steps

1. **Check build logs**: Should show "✓ built in XXXms"
2. **Check dist folder**: Should contain `index.html`, `assets/` folder
3. **Test deployed site**: Should load without console errors

## 📱 What You'll See After Successful Deploy

1. **Game Title**: "Jello Tetrix" with gradient effect
2. **Your Credit**: "Made by Carter Concessio" below title
3. **Fullscreen Button**: Purple ⛶ button next to other controls
4. **Jello Physics**: Blocks wobble when they collide
5. **Mobile Controls**: Touch buttons at bottom on mobile

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If the build still fails:

1. **Try the backup HTML**: Rename `index-backup.html` to `index.html`
2. **Clear Vercel cache**: Redeploy with cache cleared
3. **Check logs**: Look for specific error messages

The enhanced jello physics and fullscreen features are all implemented and ready to work once the build issue is resolved! 🎮
