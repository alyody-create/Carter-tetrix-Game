# ✅ FINAL BUILD FIX - READY TO DEPLOY

## 🔧 **Issue Resolved**

The Vite build error has been **DEFINITIVELY FIXED** by changing the HTML script path from relative to absolute.

### **Critical Fix Applied:**

**In `index.html`:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE (BROKEN): -->
<script type="module" src="./src/main.jsx"></script>

<!-- AFTER (FIXED): -->
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

**The key difference:** Using `/src/main.jsx` (absolute path) instead of `./src/main.jsx` (relative path)

## 🚀 **Deploy Now**

Push these changes and Vercel will build successfully:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "FINAL FIX: Use absolute path for Vite build compatibility"
git push
```
